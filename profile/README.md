## Features

### Caregiver Console

The caregiver console is a powerful tool that allows caregivers to monitor and manage crucial information about their patients. Key features include:

- **Patient Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of patient information, including location, heart rate, blood oxygen, respiration rate, and blood pressure.
- **Medication Management**: Caregivers can update and manage medication schedules for their patients.
- **Safe Locations**: Caregivers can set safe locations for patients, receiving alerts if the patient leaves these designated areas.

### iOS App for Patients

The iOS app is designed to empower patients by providing them with essential reminders and communication tools. Features include:

- **Task and Medication Reminders**: Patients receive timely reminders for tasks and medications.
- **Safe Location Alerts**: The app notifies patients if they leave their designated safe locations.
- **Emergency Assistance**: Patients can request help and call their caregivers in case of emergencies.
- **Journaling and Task Tracking**: The app incorporates a unique Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality, allowing patients to verbally document their day. The app intelligently organizes this information into tasks, journal entries, and memories.
